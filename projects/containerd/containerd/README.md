[containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. It manages the complete container lifecycle of its host system, from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision to low-level storage to network attachments and beyond.

### Updating

1. Review releases and [changelogs](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases) in upstream 
[repo](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) and decide on new version. 
1. Update the `GIT_TAG` file to have the new desired version based on the upstream release tags.
1. Compare the old tag to the new, looking specifically for Makefile changes. 
ex: [1.6.20 compared to 1.6.21](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/compare/v1.6.20...v1.7.21). Check the release [dockerfile](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/.github/workflows/release/Dockerfile)
and [Makefile](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/Makefile#L99) for any build flag changes, tag changes, dependencies, etc.
1. Verify the golang version has not changed. The version specified in the release github [action](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L16)
should be considered the source of truth.
1. Check for runc version updates via the [runc-version](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/script/setup/runc-version) file.
If there is a new version, update runc in this repo.
1. Since containerd requires cgo it is built in the builder base. Update checksums and attribution using `make build` from the containerd folder.
1. Update the version at the top of this Readme.
1. Run `make generate` from the root of the repo to update the UPSTREAM_PROJECTS.yaml file.
