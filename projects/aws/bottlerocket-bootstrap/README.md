The Bottlerocket bootstrap is a tool to help [Bottlerocket nodes](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket) bootstrap with the custom user-data generated by our patched Cluster-API bootstrap provider.
This tool can bootstrap control plane, worker and standalone etcd nodes.

## Building
This project depends on other artifacts from this repo.  To build image locally, `ARTIFACTS_BUCKET` must be supplied. For ex
the following is the presubmit bucket:

`ARTIFACTS_BUCKET=s3://projectbuildpipeline-857-pipelineoutputartifactsb-10ajmk30khe3f make build`

When building a `.git` directory is created to support go-licenses and attribution generation. After running desired targets
run `make clean` to ensure you aren't left with this `.git` which could confusion.

Refer to [building locally](../../../docs/development/building-locally.md) for more instructions.
