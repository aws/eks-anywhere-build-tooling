### Updating

1. Review commits upstream [repo](https://github.com/tinkerbell/rufio) and decide on new commit to track.
1. Update the `GIT_TAG` file to have the new desired commit based on the upstream.

1. Verify no changes have been made to the [dockerfile](https://github.com/tinkerbell/rufio/blob/main/Dockerfile) looking specifically for added runtime deps.
1. Update checksums and attribution using `make attribution checksums`.
1. Update the version at the top of this Readme.
1. Run `make generate` to update the UPSTREAM_PROJECTS.yaml file.
