# modernc.org/mathutil's license is actually mismatched
# the current version of go-license finds it to match BSD-2 where its
# really BSD-3.  The library go-liceses uses to determine the type
# has a newer version which more accurately matches between the two BSD types
# the confidence to BSD-2 is > .85 but under the .9 default whereas
# the newer version matching BSD-3 ends up being > .99 confidence
# We could remove this in the future when go-licenses upgrades
# in the meantime we have confirmed the license type and that it is acceptable
