Subject: [PATCH 14/14] Use rhsm_server_release_version as releasever

Currently image-builder does a yum update during sys prep,
this will always update the OS kernel version to latest,
for example, when using a rhel iso of 9.4, the final output
will be rhel 9.6.

This change will use rhsm_server_release_version as the releasever
during yum update so that if rhsm_server_release_version is specified,
the OS release version will not be updated to latest.
