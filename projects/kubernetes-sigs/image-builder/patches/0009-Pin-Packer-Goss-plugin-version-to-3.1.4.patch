Subject: [PATCH 09/16] Pin Packer Goss plugin version to 3.1.4

Upstream image-builder moved from installing packer-provisioner-goss through a script to installing it
via Packer config (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/commit/c0b70ae37c4aac14c156fc7b907a9b35147757df).
In the Packer config, they just specify the major version but we're using the full semver to pin it to the older
version.
