Subject: [PATCH] update coredns/corefile-migration to support 1.8.7

EKS-D 1.22-1 ships with coredns 1.8.7.  The corefile-migration package
does not currently have a release that supports 1.8.7 nor does cluster-api
or kubeadm for that matter use a version which does.  Temporarily ovewriting the version
to point to the comment upstream which added support.

Without this change, capi's webhook will deny a cluster spec with coredns 1.8.7 with
the following error:
`invalid: spec.kubeadmConfigSpec.clusterConfiguration.dns.imageTag: Forbidden: cannot migrate
CoreDNS up to '1.8.7' from '1.8.7': start version '1.8.7' not supported`
