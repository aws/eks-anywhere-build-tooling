Subject: [PATCH] Replace promptui mod to mitigate LGPL dependency

Troubleshoot has a dependency on the manifoldco/promptui
module, which in turn has a dependency on juju/ansiterm module, which is
LGPLv3 licensed. There is currently a PR to remove this dependency
(https://github.com/manifoldco/promptui/pull/181) that that has not been
merged, but the PR author has updated their own fork to remove this
dependency, so we are using that module instead of the one from manifoldco.
