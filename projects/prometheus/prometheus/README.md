## **Prometheus**

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) is an open-source monitoring solution for collecting and aggregating metrics as time series data.

### Periodic Reviews
Review [image releases](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tags) periodically to identify new releases and decide on an update plan and an update schedule.

### Updates

#### Pre-build Preparation changes
Update the patches under `patches/` folder to match the new desired version based on the upstream release tags.
Currently, this project has the following patches:
- `0001-Add-Web-UI.patch`: contain changes from running `make assets npm_licenses assets-compress` to enable embedding web UI in the Go binary. Note many resources generated by the make targets are listed under `.gitignore` and excluded from git tracking. Remove them from `.gitignore` before committing the changes.

#### Version changes
1. Update the `GIT_TAG` and `HELM_GIT_TAG` files to have the new desired version based on the upstream release tags.
1. Run `make generate` from the root of the repo to update the `UPSTREAM_PROJECTS.yaml` file.

#### Make target changes
1. Run `make add-generated-help-block` from the project root to update available make targets.
