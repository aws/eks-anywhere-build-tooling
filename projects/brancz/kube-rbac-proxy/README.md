The [kube-rbac-proxy](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy) is an HTTP proxy for a single upstream endpoint, that can perform RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using `SubjectAccessReview`. In Kubernetes clusters without NetworkPolicies, any Pod can perform requests to every other Pod in the cluster. This proxy serves to restrict requests to only those Pods that present a valid and RBAC-authorized token or client TLS certificate.

A `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container is injected by Cluster API Kubeadm manager when provisioning the Kubernetes controlplane.
