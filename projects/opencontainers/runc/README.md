[runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification.

### Updating

1. Review releases and [changelogs](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases) in upstream 
[repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and decide on new version. 
1. Update the `GIT_TAG` file to have the new desired version based on the upstream release tags.
1. Compare the old tag to the new, looking specifically for Makefile changes. 
ex: [1.1.6 compared to 1.1.7](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/compare/v1.1.6...v1.1.12). Check the release [Makefile](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/Makefile)
for any build flag changes, tag changes, dependencies, etc.  The [GO_BUILD](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/Makefile#L27) definition should be looked at closely.
1. Verify the golang version has not changed. The version specified in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/Dockerfile#L1)
should be considered the source of truth.
1. Since runc requires cgo it is built in the builder base. Update checksums and attribution using `make build` from the runc folder.
1. Update the version at the top of this Readme.
1. Run `make generate` from the root of the repo to update the UPSTREAM_PROJECTS.yaml file.
